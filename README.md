# Tokenized Sustainable Seafood Certification

## Overview

The Tokenized Sustainable Seafood Certification platform leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent system for verifying and tracking sustainable seafood from ocean to plate. By connecting producers, distributors, retailers, and consumers through a decentralized verification network, this solution addresses critical challenges in seafood supply chain transparency, illegal fishing, species fraud, and sustainability verification.

## Core Components

### 1. Producer Verification Contract
Validates and authenticates legitimate seafood sources:
- Fishing vessel registration and licensing verification
- Aquaculture facility certification
- Geographic location validation
- Catch quota compliance monitoring
- Historical compliance record maintenance
- Sustainable fishery partnership verification
- Indigenous and small-scale fisher recognition

### 2. Harvesting Method Contract
Records and verifies fishing or aquaculture techniques:
- Fishing gear type and specifications
- Bycatch mitigation measures
- Aquaculture feed sourcing documentation
- Antibiotics and treatment usage tracking
- Environmental impact assessment
- Energy usage and carbon footprint calculation
- Animal welfare compliance

### 3. Chain of Custody Contract
Tracks the movement of seafood products throughout the supply chain:
- Transfer of custody documentation
- Temperature and storage condition monitoring
- Processing facility verification
- Transportation method and route tracking
- Time-in-transit monitoring
- Volume reconciliation to prevent fraud
- Batch splitting and combining logic

### 4. Certification Contract
Validates compliance with established sustainability standards:
- Third-party certification integration (MSC, ASC, BAP, etc.)
- Customizable sustainability criteria framework
- Compliance audit documentation
- Improvement plan tracking
- Certification expiration management
- Rating system for sustainability metrics
- Verification of protected designation of origin claims

### 5. Consumer Verification Contract
Enables end consumers to verify sustainability claims:
- QR code/NFC tag generation for consumer access
- Complete provenance history visualization
- Nutrition and freshness data
- Cooking and consumption recommendations
- Consumer feedback collection
- Reward mechanisms for sustainable choices
- Educational content on seafood sustainability
